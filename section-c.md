# Section C: Trademarks

## Article 18.18: Types of Signs Registrable as Trademarks

No Party shall require, as a condition of registration, that a sign be visually perceptible, nor shall a Party deny registration of a trademark only on the ground that the sign of which it is composed is a sound. Additionally, each Party shall make best efforts to register scent marks. A Party may require a concise and accurate  description, or graphical representation, or both, as applicable, of the trademark.

## Article 18.19: Collective and Certification Marks

Each Party shall provide that trademarks include collective marks and certification marks. A Party is not obligated to treat certification marks as a separate category in its law, provided that those marks are protected. Each Party shall also provide that signs that may serve as geographical indications are capable of protection under its trademark system.[^10]

## Article 18.20: Use of Identical or Similar Signs

Each Party shall provide that the owner of a registered trademark has the exclusive right to prevent third parties that do not have the owner’s consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs, including subsequent geographical indications,[^11],[^12] for goods or services that are related to those goods or services in respect of which the owner’s trademark is registered, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. In the case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed.

## Article 18.21: Exceptions

A Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that those exceptions take account of the legitimate interest of the owner of the trademark and of third parties.

[^10] Consistent with the definition of a geographical indication in [Article 18.1](./section-a.md) (Definitions), any sign or combination of signs shall be eligible for protection under one or more of the legal means for protecting geographical indications, or a combination of such means.

[^11] For greater certainty, the exclusive right in this Article applies to cases of  unauthorised use of geographical indications with goods for which the trademark is registered, in cases in which the use of that geographical indication in the course of trade would result in a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods.

[^12] For greater certainty, the Parties understand that this Article should not be interpreted to affect their rights and obligations under Article 22 and Article 23 of the [TRIPS](./trips.md) Agreement.

Article 18.22: Well-Known Trademarks
1. No Party shall require as a condition for determining that a trademark is wellknown
that the trademark has been registered in the Party or in another jurisdiction,
included on a list of well-known trademarks, or given prior recognition as a wellknown
trademark.
2. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or
services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well-known
trademark,13 whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark in relation
to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or
services and the owner of the trademark, and provided that the interests of the owner
of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use.
3. Each Party recognises the importance of the Joint Recommendation
Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks as adopted by the
Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property and the General
Assembly of WIPO at the Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the
Member States of WIPO September 20 to 29, 1999.
4. Each Party shall provide for appropriate measures to refuse the application or
cancel the registration and prohibit the use of a trademark that is identical or similar to
a well-known trademark,14 for identical or similar goods or services, if the use of that
trademark is likely to cause confusion with the prior well-known trademark. A Party
may also provide such measures including in cases in which the subsequent trademark
is likely to deceive.
Article 18.23: Procedural Aspects of Examination, Opposition and Cancellation
Each Party shall provide a system for the examination and registration of
trademarks which includes among other things:
(a) communicating to the applicant in writing, which may be by electronic
means, the reasons for any refusal to register a trademark;
(b) providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond to
communications from the competent authorities, to contest any initial
refusal, and to make a judicial appeal of any final refusal to register a
trademark;
 13 In determining whether a trademark is well-known in a Party, that Party need not require that the
reputation of the trademark extend beyond the sector of the public that normally deals with the relevant
goods or services.
14 The Parties understand that a well-known trademark is one that was already well-known before, as
determined by a Party, the application for, registration of or use of the first-mentioned trademark.

(c) providing an opportunity to oppose the registration of a trademark or to
seek cancellation15 of a trademark; and
(d) requiring administrative decisions in opposition and cancellation
proceedings to be reasoned and in writing, which may be provided by
electronic means.
Article 18.24: Electronic Trademarks System
Each Party shall provide:
(a) a system for the electronic application for, and maintenance of,
trademarks; and
(b) a publicly available electronic information system, including an online
database, of trademark applications and of registered trademarks.
Article 18.25: Classification of Goods and Services
Each Party shall adopt or maintain a trademark classification system that is
consistent with the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of
Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks, done at Nice, June
15, 1957, as revised and amended (Nice Classification). Each Party shall provide
that:
(a) registrations and the publications of applications indicate the goods and
services by their names, grouped according to the classes established
by the Nice Classification;
16 and
(b) goods or services may not be considered as being similar to each other
on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they are classified
in the same class of the Nice Classification. Conversely, each Party
shall provide that goods or services may not be considered as being
dissimilar from each other on the ground that, in any registration or
publication, they are classified in different classes of the Nice
Classification.
 15 For greater certainty, cancellation for purposes of this Section may be implemented through
nullification or revocation proceedings. 16 A Party that relies on translations of the Nice Classification shall follow updated versions of the Nice
Classification to the extent that official translations have been issued and published.

Article 18.26: Term of Protection for Trademarks
Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of
registration of a trademark is for a term of no less than 10 years.
Article 18.27: Non-Recordal of a Licence
No Party shall require recordal of trademark licences:
(a) to establish the validity of the licence; or
(b) as a condition for use of a trademark by a licensee to be deemed to
constitute use by the holder in a proceeding that relates to the
acquisition, maintenance or enforcement of trademarks.
Article 18.28: Domain Names
1. In connection with each Party’s system for the management of its countrycode
top-level domain (ccTLD) domain names, the following shall be available:
(a) an appropriate procedure for the settlement of disputes, based on, or
modelled along the same lines as, the principles established in the
Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy, as approved by the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or
that:
(i) is designed to resolve disputes expeditiously and at low cost;
(ii) is fair and equitable;
(iii) is not overly burdensome; and
(iv) does not preclude resort to judicial proceedings; and
(b) online public access to a reliable and accurate database of contact
information concerning domain-name registrants,
in accordance with each Party’s law and, if applicable, relevant administrator policies
regarding protection of privacy and personal data.
2. In connection with each Party’s system for the management of ccTLD domain
names, appropriate remedies17 shall be available at least in cases in which a person
 17 The Parties understand that such remedies may, but need not, include, among other things,
revocation, cancellation, transfer, damages or injunctive relief.
