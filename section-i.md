# Section I: Enforcement

## Article 18.71: General Obligations

1. Each Party shall ensure that enforcement procedures as specified in this Section are available under its law[^100] so as to permit effective action against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies that constitute a deterrent to future infringements.[^101] These procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.

2. Each Party confirms that the enforcement procedures set forth in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies), Article 18.75 (Provisional Measures) and Article 18.77 (Criminal Procedures and Penalties) shall be available to the same extent with respect to acts of trademark infringement, as well as copyright or related rights infringement, in the digital environment.

3. Each Party shall ensure that its procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights are fair and equitable. These procedures shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.

4. This Section does not create any obligation:

    (a) to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of each Party to enforce its law in general; or

    (b) with respect to the distribution of resources as between the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.
    
5. In implementing the provisions of this Section in its intellectual property system, each Party shall take into account the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement of the intellectual property right and the applicable remedies and penalties, as well as the interests of third parties.

===

[^100] For greater certainty, “law” is not limited to legislation. 

[^101] For greater certainty, and subject to Article 44 of the TRIPS Agreement and the provisions of this
Agreement, each Party confirms that it makes such remedies available with respect to enterprises,
regardless of whether the enterprises are private or state-owned.

Article 18.72: Presumptions
1. In civil, criminal and, if applicable, administrative proceedings involving
copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a presumption102 that, in the
absence of proof to the contrary:
(a) the person whose name is indicated in the usual manner 103 as the
author, performer or producer of the work, performance or phonogram,
or if applicable the publisher, is the designated right holder in that
work, performance or phonogram; and
(b) the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter.
2. In connection with the commencement of a civil, administrative or criminal
enforcement proceeding involving a registered trademark that has been substantively
examined by its competent authority, each Party shall provide that the trademark be
considered prima facie valid.
3. In connection with the commencement of a civil or administrative
enforcement proceeding involving a patent that has been substantively examined and
granted104 by the competent authority of a Party, that Party shall provide that each

patentability in the territory of the Party.105,106
Article 18.73: Enforcement Practices with Respect to Intellectual Property
Rights
1. Each Party shall provide that final judicial decisions and administrative rulings
of general application pertaining to the enforcement of intellectual property rights:
 102 For greater certainty, a Party may implement this Article on the basis of sworn statements or
documents having evidentiary value, such as statutory declarations. A Party may also provide that
these presumptions are rebuttable presumptions that may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary. 103 For greater certainty, a Party may establish the means by which it shall determine what constitutes
the “usual manner” for a particular physical support.
104 For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from making available third party
procedures in connection with its fulfilment of the obligations under paragraphs 2 and 3.
105 For greater certainty, if a Party provides its administrative authorities with the exclusive authority to
determine the validity of a registered trademark or patent, nothing in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall prevent
that Party’s competent authority from suspending enforcement procedures until the validity of the
registered trademark or patent is determined by the administrative authority. In those validity
procedures, the party challenging the validity of the registered trademark or patent shall be required to
prove that the registered trademark or patent is not valid. Notwithstanding this requirement, a Party
may require the trademark holder to provide evidence of first use. 106 A Party may provide that this paragraph applies only to those patents that have been applied for,
examined and granted after the entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

3. Each Party shall provide 109 that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial
authorities have the authority at least to order the infringer to pay the right holder

following:
(a) pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of the
right holder; or
(b) additional damages.112
8. Pre-established damages under paragraphs 6 and 7 shall be set out in an
amount that would be sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm caused by
the infringement, and with a view to deterring future infringements.
9. In awarding additional damages under paragraphs 6 and 7, judicial authorities
shall have the authority to award such additional damages as they consider
appropriate, having regard to all relevant matters, including the nature of the
infringing conduct and the need to deter similar infringements in the future.
10. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, if appropriate, have the
authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning
infringement of at least copyright or related rights, patents and trademarks, that the
prevailing party be awarded payment by the losing party of court costs or fees and

law.
11. If a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint a technical or other expert in a
civil proceeding concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right and
require that the parties to the proceeding pay the costs of that expert, that Party should
seek to ensure that those costs are reasonable and related appropriately, among other
things, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably
deter recourse to such proceedings.
12. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings:
(a) at least with respect to pirated copyright goods and counterfeit
trademark goods, its judicial authorities have the authority, at the right
holder’s request, to order that the infringing goods be destroyed, except

confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data, each Party
shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of an
intellectual property right, its judicial authorities have the authority, on a justified
request of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative, the alleged
infringer to provide to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least for the

15. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities have the authority to order a
party at whose request measures were taken and that has abused enforcement
procedures with regard to intellectual property rights, including trademarks,
geographical indications, patents, copyright and related rights and industrial designs,
to provide to a party wrongfully enjoined or restrained adequate compensation for the
injury suffered because of that abuse. The judicial authorities shall also have the
authority to order the applicant to pay the defendant expenses, which may include
appropriate attorney’s fees.

require the applicant for a provisional measure in respect of an intellectual property
right to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy the judicial
authority, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that the applicant’s right is being
infringed or that the infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide
security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to
prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter
recourse to those procedures.
3. In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights
infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial
authorities have the authority to order the seizure or other taking into custody of
suspected infringing goods, materials and implements relevant to the infringement,
and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the
infringement.
Article 18.76: Special Requirements related to Border Measures
1. Each Party shall provide for applications to suspend the release of, or to
detain, any suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated
copyright goods that are imported into the territory of the Party.115
2. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its
competent authorities116 to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly
similar trademark or pirated copyright goods into free circulation is required to
provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the law of
the Party providing the procedures, there is prima facie an infringement of the right
holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may
reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspect
 115 For the purposes of this Article:
(a) counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without
authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such
goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that
thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the
Party providing the procedures under this section; and
(b) pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right
holder or person duly authorised by the right holder in the country of production and that are
made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have
constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the Party
providing the procedures under this section. 116 For the purposes of this Article, unless otherwise specified, competent authorities may include the
appropriate judicial, administrative or law enforcement authorities under a Party’s law.

goods reasonably recognisable by its competent authorities. The requirement to
provide that information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.
3. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to
require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected
counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods, to provide a
reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the
competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such
security or equivalent assurance does not unreasonably deter recourse to these
procedures. A Party may provide that the security may be in the form of a bond
conditioned to hold the defendant harmless from any loss or damage resulting from
any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities
determine that the article is not an infringing good.
4. Without prejudice to a Party’s law pertaining to privacy or the confidentiality
of information:
(a) if a Party’s competent authorities have detained or suspended the
release of goods that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark or
pirated copyright goods, that Party may provide that its competent
authorities have the authority to inform the right holder without undue
delay of the names and addresses of the consignor, exporter, consignee
or importer; a description of the goods; the quantity of the goods; and, if
known, the country of origin of the goods;117 or
(b) if a Party does not provide its competent authority with the authority
referred to in subparagraph (a) when suspect goods are detained or
suspended from release, it shall provide, at least in cases of imported
goods, its competent authorities with the authority to provide the
information specified in subparagraph (a) to the right holder normally
within 30 working days of the seizure or determination that the goods
are counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods.
5. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border
measures ex officio118 with respect to goods under customs control119 that are:
(a) imported;
(b) destined for export;120 or
(c) in transit,121,122
 117 For greater certainty, a Party may establish reasonable procedures to receive or access that
information.
118 For greater certainty, that ex officio action does not require a formal complaint from a third party or
right holder.
119 For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “goods under customs control” as meaning goods
that are subject to a Party’s customs procedures.
120 For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat goods “destined for export” as meaning exported.

and that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark goods or pirated
copyright goods.
6. Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent
authorities may determine within a reasonable period of time after the initiation of the
procedures described in paragraph 1, paragraph 5(a), paragraph 5(b) and, if
applicable, paragraph 5(c), whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual property
right.123 If a Party provides administrative procedures for the determination of an
infringement, it may also provide its authorities with the authority to impose
administrative penalties or sanctions, which may include fines or the seizure of the
infringing goods following a determination that the goods are infringing.
7. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to
order the destruction of goods following a determination that the goods are infringing.
In cases in which the goods are not destroyed, each Party shall ensure that, except in
exceptional circumstances, the goods are disposed of outside the channels of
commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm to the right holder. In regard to
counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed
shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit the release of the
goods into the channels of commerce.
8. If a Party establishes or assesses, in connection with the procedures described
in this Article, an application fee, storage fee or destruction fee, that fee shall not be
set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these procedures.
9. This Article also shall apply to goods of a commercial nature sent in small
consignments. A Party may exclude from the application of this Article small
quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers’ personal
luggage.124
Article 18.77: Criminal Procedures and Penalties
1. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at
least in cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy
 121 This subparagraph applies to suspect goods that are in transit from one customs office to another
customs office in the Party’s territory from which the goods will be exported.
122 As an alternative to this subparagraph, a Party shall instead endeavour to provide, if appropriate and
with a view to eliminating international trade in counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright
goods, available information to another Party in respect of goods that it has examined without a local
consignee and that are transhipped through its territory and destined for the territory of the other Party,
to inform that other Party’s efforts to identify suspect goods upon arrival in its territory.
123 A Party may comply with the obligation in this Article with respect to a determination that suspect
goods under paragraph 5 infringe an intellectual property right through a determination that the suspect
goods bear a false trade description.
124 For greater certainty, a Party may also exclude from the application of this Article small quantities
of goods of a non-commercial nature sent in small consignments.

on a commercial scale. In respect of wilful copyright or related rights piracy, “on a
commercial scale” includes at least:
(a) acts carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain; and
(b) significant acts, not carried out for commercial advantage or financial
gain, that have a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the
copyright or related rights holder in relation to the marketplace.125,126
2. Each Party shall treat wilful importation or exportation of counterfeit
trademark goods or pirated copyright goods on a commercial scale as unlawful
activities subject to criminal penalties.127
3. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in
cases of wilful importation128 and domestic use, in the course of trade and on a
commercial scale, of a label or packaging:129
(a) to which a trademark has been applied without authorisation that is
identical to, or cannot be distinguished from, a trademark registered in
its territory; and
(b) that is intended to be used in the course of trade on goods or in relation
to services that are identical to goods or services for which that
trademark is registered.
4. Recognising the need to address the unauthorised copying 130 of a
cinematographic work from a performance in a movie theatre that causes significant
harm to a right holder in the market for that work, and recognising the need to deter
such harm, each Party shall adopt or maintain measures, which shall at a minimum
include, but need not be limited to, appropriate criminal procedures and penalties.
 125 The Parties understand that a Party may comply with subparagraph (b) by addressing such
significant acts under its criminal procedures and penalties for non-authorised uses of protected works,
performances and phonograms in its law. 126 A Party may provide that the volume and value of any infringing items may be taken into account in
determining whether the act has a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the copyright or
related rights holder in relation to the marketplace. 127 The Parties understand that a Party may comply with its obligation under this paragraph by
providing that distribution or sale of counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods on a
commercial scale is an unlawful activity subject to criminal penalties. Furthermore, criminal
procedures and penalties as specified in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are applicable in any free trade zones in
a Party.
128 A Party may comply with its obligation relating to importation of labels or packaging through its
measures concerning distribution. 129 A Party may comply with its obligations under this paragraph by providing for criminal procedures
and penalties to be applied to attempts to commit a trademark offence.
130 For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat the term “copying” as synonymous with
reproduction.

5. With respect to the offences for which this Article requires a Party to provide
for criminal procedures and penalties, each Party shall ensure that criminal liability
for aiding and abetting is available under its law.
6. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, each Party
shall provide the following:
(a) Penalties that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary
fines sufficiently high to provide a deterrent to future acts of
infringement, consistent with the level of penalties applied for crimes
of a corresponding gravity.131
(b) Its judicial authorities have the authority, in determining penalties, to
account for the seriousness of the circumstances, which may include
circumstances that involve threats to, or effects on, health or safety.132
(c) Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to order
the seizure of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or pirated
copyright goods, any related materials and implements used in the
commission of the alleged offence, documentary evidence relevant to
the alleged offence and assets derived from, or obtained through the
alleged infringing activity. If a Party requires identification of items
subject to seizure as a prerequisite for issuing a judicial order referred
to in this subparagraph, that Party shall not require the items to be
described in greater detail than necessary to identify them for the
purpose of seizure.
(d) Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture, at least
for serious offences, of any assets derived from or obtained through the
infringing activity.
(e) Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture or
destruction of:
(i) all counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods;
(ii) materials and implements that have been predominantly used in
the creation of pirated copyright goods or counterfeit trademark
goods; and
(iii) any other labels or packaging to which a counterfeit trademark
has been applied and that have been used in the commission of
the offence.
 131 The Parties understand that there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of
imprisonment and monetary fines to be imposed in parallel.
132 A Party may also account for such circumstances through a separate criminal offence.

In cases in which counterfeit trademark goods and pirated copyright goods are
not destroyed, the judicial or other competent authorities shall ensure that,
except in exceptional circumstances, those goods are disposed of outside the
channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid causing any harm to the
right holder. Each Party shall further provide that forfeiture or destruction
under this subparagraph and subparagraph (c) shall occur without
compensation of any kind to the defendant.
(f) Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to release
or, in the alternative, provide access to, goods, material, implements,
and other evidence held by the relevant authority to a right holder for
civil133 infringement proceedings.
(g) Its competent authorities may act upon their own initiative to initiate
legal action without the need for a formal complaint by a third person
or right holder.134
7. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, a Party may
provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or forfeiture
of assets, or alternatively, a fine, the value of which corresponds to the assets derived
from, or obtained directly or indirectly through, the infringing activity.
Article 18.78: Trade Secrets135
1. In the course of ensuring effective protection against unfair competition as
provided in Article 10bis of the Paris Convention, each Party shall ensure that persons
have the legal means to prevent trade secrets lawfully in their control from being
disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others (including state-owned enterprises)
without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices.136 As
used in this Chapter, trade secrets encompass, at a minimum, undisclosed information
as provided for in Article 39.2 of the TRIPS Agreement.
2. Subject to paragraph 3, each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and
penalties for one or more of the following:
(a) the unauthorised and wilful access to a trade secret held in a computer
system;
 133 A Party may also provide this authority in connection with administrative infringement proceedings. 134 With regard to copyright and related rights piracy provided for under paragraph 1, a Party may limit
application of this paragraph to the cases in which there is an impact on the right holder’s ability to
exploit the work, performance or phonogram in the market.
135 For greater certainty, this Article is without prejudice to a Party’s measures protecting good faith
lawful disclosures to provide evidence of a violation of that Party’s law. 136 For the purposes of this paragraph “a manner contrary to honest commercial practices” means at
least practices such as breach of contract, breach of confidence and inducement to breach, and includes
the acquisition of undisclosed information by third parties that knew, or were grossly negligent in
failing to know, that those practices were involved in the acquisition.

(b) the unauthorised and wilful misappropriation 137 of a trade secret,
including by means of a computer system; or
(c) the fraudulent disclosure, or alternatively, the unauthorised and wilful
disclosure, of a trade secret, including by means of a computer system.
3. With respect to the relevant acts referred to in paragraph 2, a Party may, as
appropriate, limit the availability of its criminal procedures, or limit the level of
penalties available, to one or more of the following cases in which:
(a) the acts are for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain;
(b) the acts are related to a product or service in national or international
commerce;
(c) the acts are intended to injure the owner of such trade secret;
(d) the acts are directed by or for the benefit of or in association with a
foreign economic entity; or
(e) the acts are detrimental to a Party’s economic interests, international
relations, or national defence or national security.
Article 18.79: Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite and Cable
Signals
1. Each Party shall make it a criminal offence to:
(a) manufacture, assemble, modify, 138 import, export, sell, lease or
otherwise distribute a tangible or intangible device or system knowing
or having reason to know139 that the device or system meets at least
one of the following conditions:
(i) it is intended to be used to assist;
(ii) it is primarily of assistance; or
(iii) its principal function is solely to assist,
 137 A Party may deem the term “misappropriation” to be synonymous with “unlawful acquisition”. 138 For greater certainty, a Party may treat “assemble” and “modify” as incorporated in “manufacture”. 139 For the purposes of this paragraph, a Party may provide that “having reason to know” may be
demonstrated through reasonable evidence, taking into account the facts and circumstances

Article 18.80: Government Use of Software
1. Each Party recognises the importance of promoting the adoption of measures
to enhance government awareness of respect for intellectual property rights and of the
detrimental effects of the infringement of intellectual property rights.
 140 With regard to the criminal offences and penalties in paragraph 1 and paragraph 3, a Party may
require a demonstration of intent to avoid payment to the lawful distributor, or a demonstration of
intent to otherwise secure a pecuniary benefit to which the recipient is not entitled.
141 The obligation regarding export may be met by making it a criminal offence to possess and
distribute a device or system described in this paragraph. For the purposes of this Article, a Party may
provide that a “lawful distributor” means a person that has the lawful right in that Party’s territory to
distribute the encrypted program-carrying signal and authorise its decoding. 142 For greater certainty and for the purposes of paragraph 1(b) and paragraph 3(b), a Party may provide
that wilful receipt of an encrypted program-carrying satellite or cable signal means receipt and use of
the signal, or means receipt and decoding of the signal. 143 For greater certainty, a Party may interpret “further distribute” as “retransmit to the public”. 144 If a Party provides for civil remedies, it may require a demonstration of injury. 145 A Party may comply with its obligation in respect of “assisting another to receive” by providing for
criminal penalties to be available against a person wilfully publishing any information in order to
enable or assist another person to receive a signal without authorisation of the lawful distributor of the
signal.

which is not authorised by the relevant licence.
