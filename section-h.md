For the purposes of Article 18.58 (Right of Reproduction) and Article 18.60
(Right of Distribution) through Article 18.70 (Collective Management), the following
definitions apply with respect to performers and producers of phonograms:
broadcasting means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of
sounds or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission
by satellite is also “broadcasting”; transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting”
if the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting
organization or with its consent;
communication to the public of a performance or a phonogram means the
transmission to the public by any medium, other than by broadcasting, of sounds of a
performance or the sounds or the representations of sounds fixed in a phonogram;
fixation means the embodiment of sounds, or of the representations thereof, from
which they can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated through a device;
performers means actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret, or otherwise perform literary or artistic works
or expressions of folklore;
phonogram means the fixation of the sounds of a performance or of other sounds, or
of a representation of sounds, other than in the form of a fixation incorporated in a
cinematographic or other audiovisual work;
producer of a phonogram means a person that takes the initiative and has the
responsibility for the first fixation of the sounds of a performance or other sounds, or
the representations of sounds; and
publication of a performance or phonogram means the offering of copies of the
performance or the phonogram to the public, with the consent of the right holder, and
provided that copies are offered to the public in reasonable quantity.
Article 18.58: Right of Reproduction
Each Party shall provide 63 to authors, performers and producers of
phonograms64 the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit all reproduction of their
 63 For greater certainty, the Parties understand that it is a matter for each Party’s law to prescribe that
works, performances or phonograms in general or any specified categories of works, performances and
phonograms are not protected by copyright or related rights unless the work, performance or
phonogram has been fixed in some material form.

works, performances or phonograms in any manner or form, including in electronic
form.
Article 18.59: Right of Communication to the Public
Without prejudice to Article 11(1)(ii), Article 11bis(1)(i) and (ii), Article
11ter(1)(ii), Article 14(1)(ii), and Article 14bis(1) of the Berne Convention, each
Party shall provide to authors the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the
communication to the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including the
making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the
public may access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by
them.65
Article 18.60: Right of Distribution
Each Party shall provide to authors, performers and producers of phonograms
the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making available to the public of the
original and copies66 of their works, performances and phonograms through sale or
other transfer of ownership.
Article 18.61: No Hierarchy
Each Party shall provide that in cases in which authorisation is needed from
both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer that
owns rights in the phonogram:
(a) the need for the authorisation of the author does not cease to exist
because the authorisation of the performer or producer is also required;
and
(b) the need for the authorisation of the performer or producer does not
cease to exist because the authorisation of the author is also required.
 64References to “authors, performers, and producers of phonograms” refer also to any of their
successors in interest. 65 The Parties understand that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making a
communication does not in itself amount to communication within the meaning of this Chapter or the
Berne Convention. The Parties further understand that nothing in this Article precludes a Party from
applying Article 11bis(2) of the Berne Convention. 66 The expressions “copies” and “original and copies”, that are subject to the right of distribution in this
Article, refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation as tangible objects.

Article 18.62: Related Rights
1. Each Party shall accord the rights provided for in this Chapter with respect to
performers and producers of phonograms: to the performers and producers of
phonograms that are nationals67 of another Party; and to performances or phonograms
first published or first fixed68 in the territory of another Party.69 A performance or
phonogram shall be considered first published in the territory of a Party if it is
published in the territory of that Party within 30 days of its original publication.
2. Each Party shall provide to performers the exclusive right to authorise or
prohibit:
(a) the broadcasting and communication to the public of their unfixed
performances, unless the performance is already a broadcast
performance; and
(b) the fixation of their unfixed performances.
3. (a) Each Party shall provide to performers and producers of phonograms
the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the broadcasting or any
communication to the public of their performances or phonograms, by
wire or wireless means,70,71 and the making available to the public of
those performances or phonograms in such a way that members of the
public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen
by them.
(b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) and Article 18.65 (Limitations and
Exceptions), the application of the right referred to in subparagraph (a)
to analog transmissions and non-interactive free over-the-air
broadcasts, and exceptions or limitations to this right for those
activities, is a matter of each Party’s law.72
 67 For the purposes of determining criteria for eligibility under this Article, with respect to performers, a
Party may treat “nationals” as those who would meet the criteria for eligibility under Article 3 of the
WPPT.
68 For the purposes of this Article, fixation means the finalisation of the master tape or its equivalent. 69 For greater certainty, in this paragraph with respect to performances or phonograms first published or
first fixed in the territory of a Party, a Party may apply the criterion of publication, or alternatively, the
criterion of fixation, or both. For greater certainty, consistent with Article 18.8 (National Treatment),
each Party shall accord to performances and phonograms first published or first fixed in the territory of
another Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to performances or phonograms first
published or first fixed in its own territory.
70 With respect to broadcasting and communication to the public, a Party may satisfy the obligation by
applying Article 15(1) and Article 15(4) of the WPPT and may also apply Article 15(2) of the WPPT,
provided that it is done in a manner consistent with that Party’s obligations under Article 18.8 (National
Treatment).
71 For greater certainty, the obligation under this paragraph does not include broadcasting or
communication to the public, by wire or wireless means, of the sounds or representations of sounds
fixed in a phonogram that are incorporated in a cinematographic or other audiovisual work.
72 For the purposes of this subparagraph the Parties understand that a Party may provide for the
retransmission of non-interactive, free over-the-air broadcasts, provided that these retransmissions are

Article 18.63: Term of Protection for Copyright and Related Rights
Each Party shall provide that in cases in which the term of protection of a
work, performance or phonogram is to be calculated:73
(a) on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less
than the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death;74 and
(b) on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be:
(i) not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the
first authorised publication 75 of the work, performance or
phonogram; or
(ii) failing such authorised publication within 25 years from the
creation of the work, performance or phonogram, not less than
70 years from the end of the calendar year of the creation of the
work, performance or phonogram.76
Article 18.64: Application of Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 14.6
of the TRIPS Agreement
Each Party shall apply Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 14.6 of
the TRIPS Agreement, mutatis mutandis, to works, performances and phonograms,
and the rights in and protections afforded to that subject matter as required by this
Section.
 lawfully permitted by that Party’s government communications authority; any entity engaging in these
retransmissions complies with the relevant rules, orders or regulations of that authority; and these
retransmissions do not include those delivered and accessed over the Internet. For greater certainty this
footnote does not limit a Party’s ability to avail itself of this subparagraph.
73 For greater certainty, in implementing this Article, nothing prevents a Party from promoting certainty
for the legitimate use and exploitation of a work, performance or phonogram during its term of
protection, consistent with Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions) and that Party’s international
obligations.
74 The Parties understand that if a Party provides its nationals a term of copyright protection that
exceeds life of the author plus 70 years, nothing in this Article or Article 18.8 (National Treatment)
shall preclude that Party from applying Article 7.8 of the Berne Convention with respect to the term in
excess of the term provided in this subparagraph of protection for works of another Party.
75 For greater certainty, for the purposes of subparagraph (b), if a Party’s law provides for the
calculation of term from fixation rather than from the first authorised publication, that Party may
continue to calculate the term from fixation.
76 For greater certainty, a Party may calculate a term of protection for an anonymous or pseudonymous
work or a work of joint authorship in accordance with Article 7(3) or Article 7bis of the Berne
Convention, provided that the Party implements the corresponding numerical term of protection
required under this Article.

Article 18.65: Limitations and Exceptions
1. With respect to this Section, each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions
to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work, performance, or phonogram, and do not unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.
2. This Article does not reduce or extend the scope of applicability of the
limitations and exceptions permitted by the TRIPS Agreement, the Berne Convention,
the WCT or the WPPT.
Article 18.66: Balance in Copyright and Related Rights Systems
Each Party shall endeavour to achieve an appropriate balance in its copyright
and related rights system, among other things by means of limitations or exceptions
that are consistent with Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions), including those
for the digital environment, giving due consideration to legitimate purposes such as,
but not limited to: criticism; comment; news reporting; teaching, scholarship,
research, and other similar purposes; and facilitating access to published works for
persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled.77,78
Article 18.67: Contractual Transfers
Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related rights, any person
acquiring or holding any economic right79 in a work, performance or phonogram:
(a) may freely and separately transfer that right by contract; and
(b) by virtue of contract, including contracts of employment underlying the
creation of works, performances or phonograms, shall be able to
exercise that right in that person’s own name and enjoy fully the
benefits derived from that right.80
 77 As recognised by the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are
Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled, done at Marrakesh, June 27, 2013 (Marrakesh
Treaty). The Parties recognise that some Parties facilitate the availability of works in accessible
formats for beneficiaries beyond the requirements of the Marrakesh Treaty.
78 For greater certainty, a use that has commercial aspects may in appropriate circumstances be
considered to have a legitimate purpose under Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions). 79 For greater certainty, this provision does not affect the exercise of moral rights. 80 Nothing in this Article affects a Party’s ability to establish: (i) which specific contracts underlying the
creation of works, performances or phonograms shall, in the absence of a written agreement, result in a
transfer of economic rights by operation of law; and (ii) reasonable limits to protect the interests of the
original right holders, taking into account the legitimate interests of the transferees.

Article 18.68: Technological Protection Measures (TPMs)81
1. In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies
against the circumvention of effective technological measures that authors,
performers, and producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their
rights and that restrict unauthorised acts in respect of their works, performances, and
phonograms, each Party shall provide that any person that:
(a) knowingly, or having reasonable grounds to know, 82 circumvents
without authority any effective technological measure that controls
access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram;83 or
(b) manufactures, imports, distributes,
84 offers for sale or rental to the
public, or otherwise provides devices, products, or components, or
offers to the public or provides services, that:
(i) are promoted, advertised, or otherwise marketed by that
person 85 for the purpose of circumventing any effective
technological measure;
(ii) have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use
other than to circumvent any effective technological measure;86
or
(iii) are primarily designed, produced, or performed for the purpose
of circumventing any effective technological measure,
is liable and subject to the remedies provided for in Article 18.74 (Civil and
Administrative Procedures and Remedies).
 81 Nothing in this Agreement requires a Party to restrict the importation or domestic sale of a device
that does not render effective a technological measure the only purpose of which is to control market
segmentation for legitimate physical copies of a cinematographic film, and is not otherwise a violation
of its law. 82 For the purposes of this subparagraph, a Party may provide that reasonable grounds to know may be
demonstrated through reasonable evidence, taking into account the facts and circumstances
surrounding the alleged illegal act.
83 For greater certainty, no Party is required to impose civil or criminal liability under this subparagraph
for a person that circumvents any effective technological measure that protects any of the exclusive
rights of copyright or related rights in a protected work, performance or phonogram, but does not
control access to such that work, performance or phonogram. 84 A Party may provide that the obligations described in this subparagraph with respect to
manufacturing, importation, and distribution apply only in cases in which those activities are
undertaken for sale or rental, or if those activities prejudice the interests of the right holder of the
copyright or related right.
85 The Parties understand that this provision still applies in cases in which the person promotes,
advertises, or markets through the services of a third person. 86 A Party may comply with this paragraph if the conduct referred to in this subparagraph does not have
a commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent an effective technological measure.

Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied if any
person is found to have engaged wilfully 87 and for the purposes of commercial
advantage or financial gain88 in any of the above activities.89
A Party may provide that the criminal procedures and penalties do not apply to a nonprofit
library, museum, archive, educational institution, or public non-commercial
broadcasting entity. A Party may also provide that the remedies provided for in
Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies) do not apply to
any of the same entities provided that the above activities are carried out in good faith
without knowledge that the conduct is prohibited.
2. In implementing paragraph 1, no Party shall be obligated to require that the
design of, or the design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer
electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a response to any
particular technological measure, provided that the product does not otherwise violate
a measure implementing paragraph 1.
3. Each Party shall provide that a violation of a measure implementing this
Article is independent of any infringement that might occur under the Party’s law on
copyright and related rights.90
4. With regard to measures implementing paragraph 1:
(a) a Party may provide certain limitations and exceptions to the
measures implementing paragraph 1(a) or paragraph 1(b) in order to
enable non-infringing uses if there is an actual or likely adverse
impact of those measures on those non-infringing uses, as determined
through a legislative, regulatory, or administrative process in
accordance with the Party’s law, giving due consideration to evidence
when presented in that process, including with respect to whether
appropriate and effective measures have been taken by rights holders
to enable the beneficiaries to enjoy the limitations and exceptions to
copyright and related rights under that Party’s law;91
 87 For greater certainty, for purposes of this Article and Article 18.69 (RMI), wilfulness contains a
knowledge element.
88 For greater certainty, for purposes of this Article, Article 18.69 (RMI) and Article 18.77.1 (Criminal
Procedures and Penalties), the Parties understand that a Party may treat “financial gain” as
“commercial purposes”.
89 For greater certainty, no Party is required to impose liability under this Article and Article 18.69
(RMI) for actions taken by that Party or a third person acting with the authorisation or consent of that
Party.
90 For greater certainty, a Party is not required to treat the criminal act of circumvention set forth in
paragraph 1(a) as an independent violation, where the Party criminally penalises such acts through
other means.
91 For greater certainty, nothing in this provision requires a Party to make a new determination through
the legislative, regulatory, or administrative process with respect to limitations and exceptions to the
legal protection of effective technological measures: (i) previously established pursuant to trade
agreements in force between two or more Parties; or (ii) previously implemented by the Parties,
provided that such limitations and exceptions are otherwise consistent with this paragraph.

(b) any limitations or exceptions to a measure that implements paragraph
1(b) shall be permitted only to enable the legitimate use of a limitation
or exception permissible under this Article by its intended
beneficiaries92 and does not authorise the making available of devices,
products, components, or services beyond those intended
beneficiaries;93 and
(c) a Party shall not, by providing limitations and exceptions under
paragraph 4(a) and paragraph 4(b), undermine the adequacy of that
Party’s legal system for the protection of effective technological
measures, or the effectiveness of legal remedies against the
circumvention of such measures, that authors, performers, or
producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their
rights, or that restrict unauthorised acts in respect of their works,
performances or phonograms, as provided for in this Chapter.
5. effective technological measure means any effective94 technology, device, or
component that, in the normal course of its operation, controls access to a protected
work, performance, or phonogram, or protects copyright or related rights related to a
work, performance or phonogram.
Article 18.69: Rights Management Information (RMI) 95
1. In order to provide adequate and effective legal remedies to protect RMI:
(a) each Party shall provide that any person that, without authority, and
knowing, or having reasonable grounds to know, that it would induce,
enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of the copyright or related
right of authors, performers or producers of phonograms:
(i) knowingly96 removes or alters any RMI;
(ii) knowingly distributes or imports for distribution RMI knowing
that the RMI has been altered without authority;97 or
 92 For greater certainty, a Party may provide an exception to subparagraph 1(b) without providing a
corresponding exception to subparagraph 1(a), provided that the exception to paragraph 1(b) is limited
to enabling a legitimate use that is within the scope of limitations or exceptions to 1(a) as provided
under this subparagraph. 93 For the purposes of interpreting subparagraph 4(b) only, subparagraph 1(a) should be read to apply to
all effective technological measures as defined in paragraph 5, mutatis mutandis. 94 For greater certainty, a technological measure that can, in a usual case, be circumvented accidentally
is not an "effective" technological measure.
95 A Party may comply with the obligations in this Article by providing legal protection only to
electronic RMI.
96 For greater certainty, a Party may extend the protection afforded by this paragraph to circumstances
in which a person engages without knowledge in the acts in sub-subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii), and to
other related right holders.

Administrative Procedures and Remedies).
Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied if
any person is found to have engaged wilfully and for purposes of commercial
advantage or financial gain in any of the activities described in subparagraph
(a).
A Party may provide that the criminal procedures and penalties referred to in
paragraph 1(b) do not apply to a non-profit library, museum, archive,
educational institution or public non-commercial broadcasting entity.98
2. For greater certainty, nothing prevents a Party from excluding from a measure
that implements paragraph 1 a lawfully authorised activity that is carried out for the
purpose of law enforcement, essential security interests or other related governmental
purposes, such as the performance of a statutory function.
3. For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall obligate a Party to require a
right holder in a work, performance or phonogram to attach RMI to copies of the
work, performance or phonogram, or to cause RMI to appear in connection with a
communication of the work, performance or phonogram to the public.
4. RMI means:
(a) information that identifies a work, performance or phonogram, the
author of the work, the performer of the performance or the producer of
the phonogram; or the owner of any right in the work, performance or
phonogram;
(b) information about the terms and conditions of the use of the work,
performance or phonogram; or
(c) any numbers or codes that represent the information referred to in
subparagraphs (a) and (b),

proceedings concerning the enforcement of moral rights under its copyright law. A Party may also
meet its obligation under this sub-subparagraph, if it provides effective protection for original
compilations, provided that the acts described in this sub-subparagraph are treated as infringements of
copyright in those original compilations.

Article 18.70: Collective Management
The Parties recognise the important role of collective management societies
for copyright and related rights in collecting and distributing royalties 99 based on
practices that are fair, efficient, transparent and accountable, which may include
