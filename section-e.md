##Article 18.30: Recognition of Geographical Indications
The Parties recognise that geographical indications may be protected through a
trademark or sui generis system or other legal means.
Article 18.31: Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of
Geographical Indications
If a Party provides administrative procedures for the protection or recognition
of geographical indications, whether through a trademark or a sui generis system, that
Party shall with respect to applications for that protection or petitions for that
recognition:
(a) accept those applications or petitions without requiring intercession by
a Party on behalf of its nationals;
18
(b) process those applications or petitions without imposition of overly
burdensome formalities;
(c) ensure that its laws and regulations governing the filing of those
applications or petitions are readily available to the public and clearly
set out the procedures for these actions;
(d) make available information sufficient to allow the general public to
obtain guidance concerning the procedures for filing applications or
petitions and the processing of those applications or petitions in
general; and allow an applicant, a petitioner, or their representative to
ascertain the status of specific applications and petitions;
(e) ensure that those applications or petitions are published for opposition
and provide procedures for opposing geographical indications that are
the subject of applications or petitions; and
(f) provide for cancellation19 of the protection or recognition afforded to a
geographical indication.
 18 This subparagraph also applies to judicial procedures that protect or recognise a geographical
indication.
19 For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section, cancellation may be implemented through
nullification or revocation proceedings.

Article 18.32: Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation20
1. If a Party protects or recognises a geographical indication through the
procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection
or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party shall provide procedures that
allow interested persons to object to the protection or recognition of a geographical
indication and that allow for any such protection or recognition to be refused or
otherwise not afforded, at least, on the following grounds:
(a) the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a
trademark that is the subject of a pre-existing good faith pending
application or registration in the territory of the Party;
(b) the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a preexisting
trademark, the rights to which have been acquired in
accordance with the Party’s law; and
(c) the geographical indication is a term customary in common language
as the common name 21 for the relevant good in the territory of the
Party.
2. If a Party has protected or recognised a geographical indication through the
procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection
or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party shall provide procedures that
allow for interested persons to seek the cancellation of a geographical indication, and
that allow for the protection or recognition to be cancelled, at least, on the grounds
listed in paragraph 1. A Party may provide that the grounds listed in paragraph 1 shall
apply as of the time of filing the request for protection or recognition of a
geographical indication in the territory of the Party.22
3. No Party shall preclude the possibility that the protection or recognition of a
geographical indication may be cancelled, or otherwise cease, on the basis that the
protected or recognised term has ceased meeting the conditions upon which the
protection or recognition was originally granted in that Party.
 20 A Party is not required to apply this Article to geographical indications for wines and spirits or to
applications or petitions for those geographical indications.
21 For greater certainty, if a Party provides for the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative
Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and this Article to be applied
to geographical indications for wines and spirits or applications or petitions for those geographical
indications, the Parties understand nothing shall require a Party to protect or recognise a geographical
indication of any other Party with respect to products of the vine for which the relevant indication is
identical with the customary name of a grape variety existing in the territory of that Party. 22 For greater certainty, if the grounds listed in paragraph 1 did not exist in a Party’s law as of the time
of filing of the request for protection or recognition of a geographical indication under Article 18.31
(Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party is
not required to apply those grounds for the purposes of paragraphs 2 or 4 (Grounds of Opposition and
Cancellation) in relation to that geographical indication.

4. If a Party has in place a sui generis system for protecting unregistered
geographical indications by means of judicial procedures, that Party shall provide that
its judicial authorities have the authority to deny the protection or recognition of a
geographical indication if any of the circumstances identified in paragraph 1 has been
established.
23 That Party shall also provide a process that allows interested persons to
commence a proceeding on the grounds identified in paragraph 1.
5. If a Party provides protection or recognition of a geographical indication
through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the
Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) to the translation or
transliteration of that geographical indication, that Party shall make available
procedures that are equivalent to, and grounds that are the same as, those referred to
in paragraphs 1 and 2 with respect to that translation or transliteration.
Article 18.33: Guidelines for Determining Whether a Term is the Term
Customary in the Common Language
With respect to the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for
the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32
(Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), in determining whether a term is the term
customary in common language as the common name for the relevant good in the
territory of a Party, that Party’s authorities shall have the authority to take into
account how consumers understand the term in the territory of that Party. Factors
relevant to such consumer understanding may include:
(a) whether the term is used to refer to the type of good in question, as
indicated by competent sources such as dictionaries, newspapers and
relevant websites; and
(b) how the good referenced by the term is marketed and used in trade in
the territory of that Party.24
Article 18.34: Multi-Component Terms
With respect to the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for
the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32
(Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), an individual component of a multicomponent
term that is protected as a geographical indication in the territory of a
 23 As an alternative to this paragraph, if a Party has in place a sui generis system of the type referred to
in this paragraph as of the applicable date under Article 18.36.6 (International Agreements), that Party
shall at least provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to deny the protection or recognition
of a geographical indication if the circumstances identified in paragraph 1(c) have been established. 24 For the purposes of this subparagraph, a Party’s authorities may take into account, as appropriate,
whether the term is used in relevant international standards recognised by the Parties to refer to a type
or class of good in the territory of the Party.

Article 18.35: Date of Protection of a Geographical Indication
If a Party grants protection or recognition to a geographical indication through
the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the
Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that protection or recognition
shall commence no earlier than the filing date25 in the Party or the registration date in
the Party, as applicable.

multi-component terms, specifying the components, if any, for which
protection or recognition is being considered, or the components that
are disclaimed;
(c) in respect of opposition procedures, provide a reasonable period of
time for interested persons to oppose the protection or recognition of
the terms referred to in subparagraph (b). That period shall provide a

26 Each Party shall apply 18.33 (Guidelines for Determining Whether a Term is the Term Customary in
