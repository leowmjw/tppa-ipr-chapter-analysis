Internet Service Provider means:
(a) a provider of online services for the transmission, routing, or providing
of connections for digital online communications, between or among
points specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing,
undertaking the function in Article 18.82.2(a) (Legal Remedies and
Safe Harbours); or
(b) a provider of online services undertaking the functions in Article

Article 18.82: Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours148
1. The Parties recognise the importance of facilitating the continued development
of legitimate online services operating as intermediaries and, in a manner consistent
with Article 41 of the TRIPS Agreement, providing enforcement procedures that
permit effective action by right holders against copyright infringement covered under
this Chapter that occurs in the online environment. Accordingly, each Party shall
ensure that legal remedies are available for right holders to address such copyright
infringement and shall establish or maintain appropriate safe harbours in respect of
online services that are Internet Service Providers. This framework of legal remedies
and safe harbours shall include:
(a) legal incentives 149 for Internet Service Providers to cooperate with
copyright owners to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of
copyrighted materials or, in the alternative, to take other action to deter
the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials;
and
 147 Annex 18-F applies to this Section. 148 Annex 18-E applies to Article 18.82.3 and Article 18.82.4 (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours). 149 For greater certainty, the Parties understand that implementation of the obligations in paragraph 1(a)
on “legal incentives” may take different forms.

(b) limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary relief
against Internet Service Providers for copyright infringements that they
do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or
networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.150
2. The limitations described in paragraph 1(b) shall include limitations in respect
of the following functions:
(a) transmitting, routing or providing connections for material without
modification of its content 151 or the intermediate and transient
storage of that material done automatically in the course of such a
technical process;
(b) caching carried out through an automated process;
(c) storage,152 at the direction of a user, of material residing on a system
or network controlled or operated by or for the Internet Service
Provider;153 and
(d) referring or linking users to an online location by using information
location tools, including hyperlinks and directories.
3. To facilitate effective action to address infringement, each Party shall
prescribe in its law conditions for Internet Service Providers to qualify for the
limitations described in paragraph 1(b), or, alternatively, shall provide for
circumstances under which Internet Service Providers do not qualify for the
limitations described in paragraph 1(b):154,155
 150 The Parties understand that, to the extent that a Party determines, consistent with its international
legal obligations, that a particular act does not constitute copyright infringement, there is no obligation
to provide for a limitation in relation to that act.
151 The Parties understand that such modification does not include a modification made as part of a
technical process or for solely technical reasons such as division into packets.
152 For greater certainty, a Party may interpret “storage” as “hosting”. 153 For greater certainty, the storage of material may include e-mails and their attachments stored in the
Internet Service Provider’s server and web pages residing on the Internet Service Provider’s server.
154 A Party may comply with the obligations in paragraph 3 by maintaining a framework in which:
(a) there is a stakeholder organisation that includes representatives of both Internet Service
Providers and right holders, established with government involvement;
(b) that stakeholder organisation develops and maintains effective, efficient and timely
procedures for entities certified by the stakeholder organisation to verify, without undue
delay, the validity of each notice of alleged copyright infringement by confirming that the
notice is not the result of mistake or misidentification, before forwarding the verified notice
to the relevant Internet Service Provider;
(c) there are appropriate guidelines for Internet Service Providers to follow in order to qualify
for the limitation described in paragraph 1(b), including requiring that the Internet Service
Provider promptly removes or disables access to the identified materials upon receipt of a
verified notice; and be exempted from liability for having done so in good faith in
accordance with those guidelines; and
(d) there are appropriate measures that provide for liability in cases in which an Internet Service
Provider has actual knowledge of the infringement or awareness of facts or circumstances
from which the infringement is apparent.

(a) With respect to the functions referred to in paragraph 2(c) and
paragraph 2(d), these conditions shall include a requirement for
Internet Service Providers to expeditiously remove or disable access to
material residing on their networks or systems upon obtaining actual
knowledge of the copyright infringement or becoming aware of facts or
circumstances from which the infringement is apparent, such as
through receiving a notice 156 of alleged infringement from the right
holder or a person authorised to act on its behalf,
(b) An Internet Service Provider that removes or disables access to
material in good faith under subparagraph (a) shall be exempt from any
liability for having done so, provided that it takes reasonable steps in
advance or promptly after to notify the person whose material is
removed or disabled.157
4. If a system for counter-notices is provided under a Party’s law, and if material
has been removed or access has been disabled in accordance with paragraph 3, that
Party shall require that the Internet Service Provider restores the material subject to a
counter-notice, unless the person giving the original notice seeks judicial relief within
a reasonable period of time.
5. Each Party shall ensure that monetary remedies are available in its legal
system against any person that makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a
notice or counter-notice that causes injury to any interested party158 as a result of an
Internet Service Provider relying on the misrepresentation.
6. Eligibility for the limitations in paragraph 1 shall not be conditioned on the
Internet Service Provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts
indicating infringing activity.
 155 The Parties understand that a Party that has yet to implement the obligations in paragraphs 3 and 4
will do so in a manner that is both effective and consistent with that Party’s existing constitutional
provisions. To that end, a Party may establish an appropriate role for the government that does not
impair the timeliness of the process provided in paragraphs 3 and 4, and does not entail advance
government review of each individual notice.
156 For greater certainty, a notice of alleged infringement, as may be set out under a Party’s law, must
contain information that:
(a) is reasonably sufficient to enable the Internet Service Provider to identify the work,
performance or phonogram claimed to be infringed, the alleged infringing material, and the
online location of the alleged infringement; and
(b) has a sufficient indicia of reliability with respect to the authority of the person sending the
notice. 157 With respect to the function in subparagraph 2(b), a Party may limit the requirements of paragraph 3
related to an Internet Service Provider removing or disabling access to material to circumstances in
which the Internet Service Provider becomes aware or receives notification that the cached material has
been removed or access to it has been disabled at the originating site.
158 For greater certainty, the Parties understand that, “any interested party” may be limited to those with
a legal interest recognised under that Party’s law.
