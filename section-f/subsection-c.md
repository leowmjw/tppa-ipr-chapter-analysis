approval of pharmaceutical products in an efficient and timely manner, with a view to
avoiding unreasonable or unnecessary delays.
2. With respect to a pharmaceutical product45 that is subject to a patent, each
Party shall make available an adjustment46 of the patent term to compensate the patent
owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the
marketing approval process.47,48
3. For greater certainty, in implementing the obligations of this Article, each
Party may provide for conditions and limitations, provided that the Party continues to
give effect to this Article.
4. With the objective of avoiding unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent
term, a Party may adopt or maintain procedures that expedite the processing of
marketing approval applications.
Article 18.49: Regulatory Review Exception

new pharmaceutical product, the submission of undisclosed test or
 45 A Party may comply with the obligations of this paragraph with respect to a pharmaceutical product
or, alternatively, with respect to a pharmaceutical substance.
46 For greater certainty, a Party may alternatively make available a period of additional sui generis
protection to compensate for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the
marketing approval process. The sui generis protection shall confer the rights conferred by the patent,
subject to any conditions and limitations pursuant to paragraph 3.
47 Notwithstanding Article 18.10 (Application of Chapter to Existing Subject Matter and Prior Acts),
this Article shall apply to all applications for marketing approval filed after the date of entry into force

other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the product, 51 that
Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person
that previously submitted such information, to market the same or a
similar52 product on the basis of:
(i) that information; or
(ii) the marketing approval granted to the person that submitted
such information,
for at least five years53 from the date of marketing approval of the new
pharmaceutical product in the territory of the Party.
(b) If a Party permits, as a condition of granting marketing approval for a
new pharmaceutical product, the submission of evidence of prior
marketing approval of the product in another territory, that Party shall
not permit third persons, without the consent of a person that
previously submitted such information concerning the safety and
efficacy of the product, to market a same or a similar product based on
evidence relating to prior marketing approval in the other territory for
at least five years from the date of marketing approval of the new
pharmaceutical product in the territory of that Party.54
2. Each Party shall:55
(a) apply paragraph 1, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least three years
with respect to new clinical information submitted as required in
support of a marketing approval of a previously approved
pharmaceutical product covering a new indication, new formulation or
new method of administration; or, alternatively,
(b) apply paragraph 1, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least five years
to new pharmaceutical products that contain a chemical entity that has
not been previously approved in that Party.56
 51 Each Party confirms that the obligations of this Article, and Article 18.52 (Biologics) apply to cases
in which the Party requires the submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning: (a) only the
safety of the product, (b) only the efficacy of the product or (c) both.
52 For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section, a pharmaceutical product is “similar” to a
previously approved pharmaceutical product if the marketing approval, or, in the alternative, the
applicant’s request for such approval, of that similar pharmaceutical product is based upon the
undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the previously approved
pharmaceutical product, or the prior approval of that previously approved product. 53 For greater certainty, a Party may limit the period of protection under paragraph 1 to five years, and
the period of protection under Article 18.52.1(a) (Biologics) to eight years. 54 Annex 18-D applies to this subparagraph. 55 A Party that provides a period of at least eight years of protection pursuant to paragraph 1 is not
required to apply paragraph 2.

3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 and Article 18.52 (Biologics), a Party
may take measures to protect public health in accordance with:
(a) the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health;
(b) any waiver of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement granted by WTO
Members in accordance with the WTO Agreement to implement the
Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health and that is in force between
the Parties; or
(c) any amendment of the TRIPS Agreement to implement the Declaration
on TRIPS and Public Health that enters into force with respect to the

Article 18.51: Measures Relating to the Marketing of Certain Pharmaceutical
Products
1. If a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a
pharmaceutical product, persons, other than the person originally submitting the
safety and efficacy information, to rely on evidence or information concerning the
safety and efficacy of a product that was previously approved, such as evidence of
prior marketing approval by the Party or in another territory, that Party shall provide:
(a) a system to provide notice to a patent holder57 or to allow for a patent
holder to be notified prior to the marketing of such a pharmaceutical
product, that such other person is seeking to market that product during
the term of an applicable patent claiming the approved product or its
approved method of use;
(b) adequate time and opportunity for such a patent holder to seek, prior to
the marketing58 of an allegedly infringing product, available remedies
in subparagraph (c); and
(c) procedures, such as judicial or administrative proceedings, and
expeditious remedies, such as preliminary injunctions or equivalent
effective provisional measures, for the timely resolution of disputes
concerning the validity or infringement of an applicable patent
 56 For the purposes of Article 18.50.2(b) (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), a Party may
choose to protect only the undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy relating to
the chemical entity that has not been previously approved.
57 For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Article, a Party may provide that a “patent holder”
includes a patent licensee or the authorised holder of marketing approval. 58 For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), a Party may treat “marketing” as commencing at the time of
listing for purposes of the reimbursement of pharmaceutical products pursuant to a national healthcare
programme operated by a Party and inscribed in the Schedule to Annex 26-A (Transparency and
Procedural Fairness for Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices).

claiming an approved pharmaceutical product or its approved method
of use.
2. As an alternative to paragraph 1, a Party shall instead adopt or maintain a
system other than judicial proceedings that precludes, based upon patent-related
information submitted to the marketing approval authority by a patent holder or the
applicant for marketing approval, or based on direct coordination between the
marketing approval authority and the patent office, the issuance of marketing approval
to any third person seeking to market a pharmaceutical product subject to a patent
claiming that product, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent holder.
Article 18.52: Biologics59
1. With regard to protecting new biologics, a Party shall either:
(a) with respect to the first marketing approval in a Party of a new
pharmaceutical product that is or contains a biologic, 60 , 61 provide
effective market protection through the implementation of Article
18.50.1 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article
18.50.3, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least eight years from the
date of first marketing approval of that product in that Party; or,
alternatively,
(b) with respect to the first marketing approval in a Party of a new
pharmaceutical product that is or contains a biologic, provide effective
market protection:
(i) through the implementation of Article 18.50.1 (Protection of
Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.50.3, mutatis
mutandis, for a period of at least five years from the date of first
marketing approval of that product in that Party,
(ii) through other measures, and
(iii) recognising that market circumstances also contribute to
effective market protection
 59 Annex 18-B, Annex 18-C and Annex 18-D apply to this Article. 60 Nothing requires a Party to extend the protection of this paragraph to:
(a) any second or subsequent marketing approval of such a pharmaceutical product; or
(b) a pharmaceutical product that is or contains a previously approved biologic. 61 Each Party may provide that an applicant may request approval of a pharmaceutical product that is or
contains a biologic under the procedures set forth in Article 18.50.1(a) and Article 18.50.1(b)
(Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) within five years of the date of entry into force of this
Agreement for that Party, provided that other pharmaceutical products in the same class of products
have been approved by that Party under the procedures set forth in Article 18.50.1(a) and Article
18.50.1(b) before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

 to deliver a comparable outcome in the market.
2. For the purposes of this Section, each Party shall apply this Article to, at a
minimum, a product that is, or, alternatively, contains, a protein produced using
biotechnology processes, for use in human beings for the prevention, treatment, or
cure of a disease or condition.
3. Recognising that international and domestic regulation of new pharmaceutical
products that are or contain a biologic is in a formative stage and that market
circumstances may evolve over time, the Parties shall consult after 10 years from the
date of entry into force of this Agreement, or as otherwise decided by the
Commission, to review the period of exclusivity provided in paragraph 1 and the
scope of application provided in paragraph 2, with a view to providing effective
incentives for the development of new pharmaceutical products that are or contain a
biologic, as well as with a view to facilitating the timely availability of follow-on
biosimilars, and to ensuring that the scope of application remains consistent with
international developments regarding approval of additional categories of new
pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic.
Article 18.53: Definition of New Pharmaceutical Product
For the purposes of Article 18.50.1 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other
Data), a new pharmaceutical product means a pharmaceutical product that does not
contain62 a chemical entity that has been previously approved in that Party.
Article 18.54: Alteration of Period of Protection
Subject to Article 18.50.3 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), if a
product is subject to a system of marketing approval in the territory of a Party
pursuant to Article 18.47 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data for
Agricultural Chemical Products), Article 18.50 or Article 18.52 (Biologics) and is
also covered by a patent in the territory of that Party, the Party shall not alter the
period of protection that it provides pursuant to Article 18.47, Article 18.50 or Article
18.52 in the event that the patent protection terminates on a date earlier than the end
of the period of protection specified in Article 18.47, Article 18.50 or Article 18.52.
 62 For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “contain” as meaning utilize.
