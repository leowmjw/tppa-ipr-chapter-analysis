# Subsection A: General Patents

Article 18.37: Patentable Subject Matter
1. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4, each Party shall make patents available for any
invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of technology, provided that the
invention is new, involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial application.
30
2. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4 and consistent with paragraph 1, each Party
confirms that patents are available for inventions claimed as at least one of the
following: new uses of a known product, new methods of using a known product, or
new processes of using a known product. A Party may limit those new processes to
those that do not claim the use of the product as such.
3. A Party may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within their
territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public
or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid
serious prejudice to nature or the environment, provided that such exclusion is not
made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by its law. A Party may also
exclude from patentability:
(a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of
humans or animals;
(b) animals other than microorganisms, and essentially biological
processes for the production of plants or animals, other than nonbiological
and microbiological processes.
4. A Party may also exclude from patentability plants other than microorganisms.
However, consistent with paragraph 1 and subject to paragraph 3, each Party confirms
that patents are available at least for inventions that are derived from plants.
Article 18.38: Grace Period
Each Party shall disregard at least information contained in public disclosures
used to determine if an invention is novel or has an inventive step, if the public
disclosure:31,32
 30 For the purposes of this Section, a Party may deem the terms “inventive step” and “capable of
industrial application” to be synonymous with the terms “non-obvious” and “useful”, respectively. In
determinations regarding inventive step, or non-obviousness, each Party shall consider whether the
claimed invention would have been obvious to a person skilled, or having ordinary skill in the art,
having regard to the prior art.

(a) was made by the patent applicant or by a person that obtained the
information directly or indirectly from the patent applicant; and
(b) occurred within 12 months prior to the date of the filing of the
application in the territory of the Party.
Article 18.39: Patent Revocation
1. Each Party shall provide that a patent may be cancelled, revoked or nullified
only on grounds that would have justified a refusal to grant the patent. A Party may
also provide that fraud, misrepresentation or inequitable conduct may be the basis for
cancelling, revoking or nullifying a patent or holding a patent unenforceable.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may provide that a patent may be
revoked, provided it is done in a manner consistent with Article 5A of the Paris
Convention and the TRIPS Agreement.
Article 18.40: Exceptions
A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a
patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal
exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of
the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.
Article 18.41: Other Use Without Authorisation of the Right Holder
The Parties understand that nothing in this Chapter limits a Party’s rights and
obligations under Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, any waiver or any amendment
to that Article that the Parties accept.
 31 No Party shall be required to disregard information contained in applications for, or registrations of,
intellectual property rights made available to the public or published by a patent office, unless
erroneously published or unless the application was filed without the consent of the inventor or their
successor in title, by a third person who obtained the information directly or indirectly from the
inventor.
32 For greater certainty, a Party may limit the application of this Article to disclosures made by, or
obtained directly or indirectly from, the inventor or joint inventor. For greater certainty, a Party may
provide that, for the purposes of this Article, information obtained directly or indirectly from the patent
applicant may be information contained in the public disclosure that was authorised by, or derived
from, the patent applicant.

Article 18.42: Patent Filing
Each Party shall provide that if an invention is made independently by more
than one inventor, and separate applications claiming that invention are filed with, or
for, the relevant authority of the Party, that Party shall grant the patent on the
application that is patentable and that has the earliest filing date or, if applicable,
priority date,
33 unless that application has, prior to publication,34 been withdrawn,
abandoned or refused.
Article 18.43: Amendments, Corrections and Observations
Each Party shall provide a patent applicant with at least one opportunity to
make amendments, corrections and observations in connection with its application.
35
Article 18.44: Publication of Patent Applications
1. Recognising the benefits of transparency in the patent system, each Party shall
endeavour to publish unpublished pending patent applications promptly after the
expiration of 18 months from the filing date or, if priority is claimed, from the earliest
priority date.
2. If a pending application is not published promptly in accordance with
paragraph 1, a Party shall publish that application or the corresponding patent, as soon
as practicable.
3. Each Party shall provide that an applicant may request the early publication of
an application prior to the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph 1.
Article 18.45: Information Relating to Published Patent Applications and
Granted Patents
For published patent applications and granted patents, and in accordance with
the Party’s requirements for prosecution of such applications and patents, each Party
shall make available to the public at least the following information, to the extent that
such information is in the possession of the competent authorities and is generated on,
or after, the date of the entry into force of this Agreement for that Party:
 33 A Party shall not be required to apply this Article in cases involving derivation or in situations
involving any application that has or had, at any time, at least one claim having an effective filing date
before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party or any application that has or had, at
any time, a priority claim to an application that contains or contained such a claim. 34 For greater certainty, a Party may grant the patent to the subsequent application that is patentable, if
an earlier application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or refused, or is not prior art against the
subsequent application. 35 A Party may provide that such amendments do not go beyond the scope of the disclosure of the
invention, as of the filing date.

(a) search and examination results, including details of, or information
related to, relevant prior art searches;
(b) as appropriate, non-confidential communications from applicants; and
(c) patent and non-patent related literature citations submitted by
applicants and relevant third parties.
Article 18.46: Patent Term Adjustment for Patent Office Delays
1. Each Party shall make best efforts to process patent applications in an efficient
and timely manner, with a view to avoiding unreasonable or unnecessary delays.
2. A Party may provide procedures for a patent applicant to request to expedite
the examination of its patent application.
3. If there are unreasonable delays in a Party’s issuance of patents, that Party
shall provide the means to, and at the request of the patent owner shall, adjust the term
of the patent to compensate for such delays.36
4. For the purposes of this Article, an unreasonable delay at least shall include a
delay in the issuance of a patent of more than five years from the date of filing of the
application in the territory of the Party, or three years after a request for examination
of the application has been made, whichever is later. A Party may exclude, from the
determination of such delays, periods of time that do not occur during the
processing 37 of, or the examination of, the patent application by the granting
authority; periods of time that are not directly attributable38 to the granting authority;
as well as periods of time that are attributable to the patent applicant.39
 36 Annex 18-D applies to this paragraph. 37 For the purposes of this paragraph, a Party may interpret processing to mean initial administrative
processing and administrative processing at the time of grant.
38 A Party may treat “delays that are not directly attributable to the granting authority” as delays that are
outside the direction or control of the granting authority. 39 Notwithstanding Article 18.10 (Application of Chapter to Existing Subject Matter and Prior Acts),
this Article shall apply to all patent applications filed after the date of entry into force of this
Agreement for that Party, or the date two years after the signing of this Agreement, whichever is later
for that Party
