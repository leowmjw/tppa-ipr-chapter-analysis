# Subsection B: Measures Relating to Agricultural Chemical Products

## Article 18.47: Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data for Agricultural
Chemical Products
1. If a Party requires, as a condition for granting marketing approval40 for a new
agricultural chemical product, the submission of undisclosed test or other data
concerning the safety and efficacy of the product,41 that Party shall not permit third
persons, without the consent of the person that previously submitted such information,
to market the same or a similar42 product on the basis of that information or the
marketing approval granted to the person that submitted such test or other data for at
least ten years43 from the date of marketing approval of the new agricultural chemical
product in the territory of the Party.
2. If a Party permits, as a condition of granting marketing approval for a new
agricultural chemical product, the submission of evidence of a prior marketing
approval of the product in another territory, that Party shall not permit third persons,
without the consent of the person that previously submitted undisclosed test or other
data concerning the safety and efficacy of the product in support of that prior
marketing approval, to market the same or a similar product based on that undisclosed
test or other data, or other evidence of the prior marketing approval in the other
territory, for at least ten years from the date of marketing approval of the new
agricultural chemical product in the territory of the Party.
3. For the purposes of this Article, a new agricultural chemical product is one
that contains44 a chemical entity that has not been previously approved in the territory
of the Party for use in an agricultural chemical product.
 40 For the purposes of this Chapter, the term “marketing approval” is synonymous with “sanitary
approval” under a Party’s law.
41 Each Party confirms that the obligations of this Article apply to cases in which the Party requires the
submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning: (a) only the safety of the product, (b) only the
efficacy of the product or (c) both.
42 For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section, an agricultural chemical product is “similar” to
a previously approved agricultural chemical product if the marketing approval, or, in the alternative, the
applicant’s request for such approval, of that similar agricultural chemical product is based upon the
undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the previously approved agricultural
chemical product, or the prior approval of that previously approved product.
43 For greater certainty, a Party may limit the period of protection under this Article to 10 years. 44 For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “contain” as meaning utilize. For greater certainty,
for the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “utilize” as requiring the new chemical entity to be
primarily responsible for the product’s intended effect.
